### Modules:

- Github
- Bitbucket (todo)
- Gitlab (todo)


### todo:


- search for meta specific: for example if you're only using this for twitter specific apis, then allow the user to search repos "twitter" to narrow results
- Rate limiting:
    - Check current token's rate limit
    - If it has expired, move on to the next token
    - If all tokens are rate-limited, print a message "We recommend you create and add another token"
- Slack notifications
- Email notifications
- Save to sqlite file for example: <br>
    1. repos:
        - id
        - repo_name (name of the repo)
        - scanned_at (when we last scanned it)
        - commit_id (id of the commit so we don't scan again)
    2. credentials:
        - id
        - repo_id (repo we scanned and found creds)
        - match (what metadata was used)
        - name (name of the metadata)
        - credentials (json object of the credentials/location)
- more metadata to search for
- maybe if credentials are found, keep a local copy of the repo???
